# Plasmid-Internship 
During my internship at Plasmid Artificial Intelligence, I had the opportunity to work on two projects that significantly enhanced my skills in machine learning and data analysis.

The first project, which was a minor one, focused on k-means clustering. This project involved grouping data points into clusters based on their similarities, which is a fundamental technique in unsupervised learning. Through this project, I gained practical experience in handling and preprocessing data, implementing the k-means algorithm, and visualizing the results to draw meaningful insights.

The second project, which was my major undertaking, involved developing a spam message detection system. This project was aimed at classifying messages as spam or not spam using various machine learning techniques. I utilized natural language processing (NLP) methods to preprocess the text data and implemented algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and ensemble methods to achieve high accuracy in detecting spam messages. This project not only honed my skills in supervised learning and NLP but also provided me with a deep understanding of model evaluation and optimization techniques.

You can find more details about these projects in my report and the accompanying Google Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14oo2VLzmWhOMMJ3MoZwTSDDgCsCWTaOH#scrollTo=18136FvTuwMR).
